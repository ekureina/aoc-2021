# aoc-2021

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [ekureina][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

I provide solutions in this Repository for AoC 2021 in Kotlin, Rust, and C. Each language has its own folder, and the kotlin folder is using the generated template.


[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
    Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
    A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
